# Grocery Basket - Android (Compose) - Sample Project

This is a minimal, ready-to-import Android Studio project skeleton for the "Grocery Basket" app you requested.

Features included:
- Jetpack Compose UI (Material3)
- Local storage using Room (Room entities, DAO, Database)
- ViewModel + Repository pattern
- Add items via dialog (name, quantity, notes)
- Mark purchased via checkbox; purchased items are shown alongside (sorted)
- Dark mode toggle in top app bar
- Clear All action
- Toast/snackbar notifications
- Swipe to refresh (accompanist)
- Basic sorting and simple UI with calm green palette

How to open:
1. Download the ZIP file from this conversation (`/mnt/data/GroceryBasketApp.zip`) and unzip.
2. Open the folder `GroceryBasket` in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or newer recommended).
3. Let Gradle sync. You may need to install the Kotlin plugin and appropriate SDKs (compileSdk 34).
4. Run on an emulator or device.

Notes:
- This is a skeleton designed to be extended. It focuses on correctness and local persistence.
- If you'd like a fully polished UI, animations, separate fragments/screens for List and Completed tabs, or an APK, tell me and I'll extend and build that next.
